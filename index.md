# Security Learning Environment & Homelab

[About Me / Professional Background](about.md)

## üìã Executive Summary
A dedicated homelab environment built for hands-on learning in cybersecurity, with a current focus on [PNPT (Practical Network Penetration Tester) certification](https://certifications.tcm-sec.com/pnpt/). This environment serves as both a practical learning platform and a foundation for developing real-world security testing experience.

## üéØ Current Learning Focus
### Certification Preparation
- Active Directory attack methodologies
- Windows domain security testing
- Building practical testing experience in isolated lab environment
- Actively pursuing [PNPT certification](https://certifications.tcm-sec.com/pnpt/)

### Skill Development
- Security testing fundamentals
- Network security concepts
- Infrastructure automation basics

## üî¨ Security Labs & Testing Environments

### Active Directory Lab
- Dedicated network segment for testing:
  - Windows domain environment for PNPT preparation
  - Kali Linux attack machine, Windows 11/Windows Server
  - Isolated from production services
  - AD attack and defense scenarios

### Web Application Security Lab
- OWASP Juice Shop with Burp Suite and FoxyProxy setup
- Key vulnerability focus:
  - SQL Injection and authentication attacks
  - Data exposure and XXE vulnerabilities
  - Access control and security misconfigurations
  - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) techniques
- Emphasis on testing methodology and documentation

## üõ°Ô∏è Network Architecture
### Security Design
- Isolated internal network - no external exposure
- Network segmentation for service isolation
- Internal PKI using Step-CA signed certificates

### Network Segmentation
